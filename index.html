          <h1 data-magellan-destination="work blurb">Hello!<br> My name is Dezzie.</h1>
              <p>I am part of the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/" target="new">IBM Watson</a> core design team, based out of the <a href="http://ibm.com/design" target="new">IBM Design</a> Studio in Austin, TX. Currently, I'm working on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/conversation/" target="new">Watson Conversation</a>, which is an enterprise-grade product for building chatbots. I miss the old Internet.
              <!--
I have become comfortable designing with "emerging" AI such as machine learning, natural language processing, linguistic analysis, and a little bit of deep learning. But as a designer, I know more about the people who would benefit from this technology and how they would use it. It helps that I used to be in psychology, but I did also start making websites when I was 14.</p>    
          <p>While I do not have a formal design education, I align best with the Swiss style and like to use the word "vulgarity."</p>
          <p>Sometimes I speak at conferences, but only when I think I have something worthwhile to add to the industry (and it's not NDA). Now I am trying to write more. I still enjoy teaching and helping people discern if working in tech is right for them.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day, I just love the Internet. If there was no Internet I would not be a designer. I would have listened to my immigrant parents, become a doctor, and be really bored. </p>
