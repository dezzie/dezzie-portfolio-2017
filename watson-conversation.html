  <p>In 2015, when I joined the Watson design team, Conversation was one of several Watson Platform Services, a group of API -based offerings geared towards the developer user. As a service, it enabled a developer to automate branching conversations between a user and an application. The result would be a conversational chatbot experience that communicated in and understood natural language.</p>

  <p>But as we began to learn more about how real users worked with Watson technologies, we increasingly found that developers were almost never able to single-handedly do the work needed to infuse cognitive capabilities into a business setting. They worked in concert with subject-matter experts, data analysts, and customer-facing staff. Watson Conversation was the first Platform Service to receive tooling, the graphical user interface for these non-developer users to do their work.</p>

  <p>During my time on the Conversation team, I've worked alongside a multidisciplinary team of designers, remote teams of engineers and product managers, and tested my work with remote sponsor users. We worked in an Agile software development state of mind. Throughout the most of 2017, I was also the Design Lead for the Deploy part of the product.</p>

  <p>Here are some tidbits of my work on this part of the product. I am working around an NDA, and I also prefer to focus on my  individual contributions.</p>
