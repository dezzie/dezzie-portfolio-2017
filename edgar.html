              <h2>The SEC's mission is to promote fairness in markets, striking a balance between protecting investors and encouraging capital formation.</h2>

                <p><a href="http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html" target="new">EDGAR</a> is a database that allows anyone to access real-time information about publicly traded companies. From mundane filings about a company's quarterly earnings to juicy paper trails about your favorite tycoon's insider transactions, EDGAR offers a wealth of information for investment experts to investigative journalists alike (pun intended).</p>

                <!--gov thingie
                <p>In keeping with a passion for designing a better government web, EDGAR is allowing me to bring what I have learned at the CFPB to a new group of people who also want to promote financial fairness and are ready for change.</p>
              -->

                <p>I took a <a href="" target="new">slippy UX"</a> approach to redesigning the EDGAR interface, one that would allow users to focus on getting what they needed and nothing else. They've got more important things to do.</p>

          <h2>Paper prototyping a search interface</h2>
          <p>Working with a new team at CHIEF HQ, some of my colleagues hadn't worked with robust browser applications before. I turned to paper prototypes to quickly convey initial directions and work out any major, unseen dead ends together.</p>

          <h2>Architecting the interface</h2>
          <p>EDGAR's landing page currently lacks a meaningful introduction describing what it is, and the things users can do with it.</p>

        <h2>WHY DID YOU CHANGE IT?!</h2>
        <p>A simple onboarding experience provides all the information users need to know to get back to work using the new EDGAR. Curently, new users must download and search through a Word document to get started. My feelings on the rampant use of type of documentation in the government <a href="api.html">have been previously expressed</a>.</p>

        <h2>Search results</h2>
        <p>A simpler, cleaner, search results view demonstrates information architecture decisions aimed at reducing cognitive overload.</p>
          <a href="img/edgar/wire3.png" target="new"><img src="img/edgar/wire3.png"></a>
        <h2>Filtering</h2>
        <p>The UI compartmentalizes tasks in the search process to improve focus, not break it.</p>
          <a href="img/edgar/wire4.png" target="new"><img src="img/edgar/wire4.png"></a>
        <h2>Connecting the dots</h2>
        <p>Facets are different from filters in that they allow users to find connections between companies and people. Whereas Filters are used to narrow down a large number of results, users are in sleuth mode when using Facets.</p>
          <a href="img/edgar/wire5.png" target="new"><img src="img/edgar/wire5.png"></a>
        <h2>Viewing the details</h2>
        <p>This is what a typical SEC filing document looks like. Taking a cue from material design, the UI helps users focus on scanning a filing, but does not break their flow, since they may not find what they're looking for the right time.</p>
          <a href="img/edgar/wire6.png" target="new"><img src="img/edgar/wire6.png"></a>
           <p>EDGAR's redesign is in the early stages of development. Here's why I chose to design 2 directions:</p> 
           <p>In the past, unprecedented government-specific quirks have resulted in major parts of a tool's architecture to drastically change, undermining the designer's intent long after she can do anything about it. Providing a backup plan ensures that, no matter what happens, the SEC team can get it right the first time.</p>
