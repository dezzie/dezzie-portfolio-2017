Portfolio for 2015

This is a work in progress!

Grab my last portfolio (it's a PDF, yes I know, T_T) [here](https://github.com/dezzie/hai/blob/gh-pages/download/desiree_garcia_portfolio_dec_2014.pdf).

If you want, my resume is [here](https://github.com/dezzie/hai/blob/gh-pages/download/hire_dezzie.pdf) too. 



**Colophon**

The typeface on all my stuff is Arquitecta, made by Latinotype. Its name is a pun for what they make. It is also a pun for what I am doing right now.
